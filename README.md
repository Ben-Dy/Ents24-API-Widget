# Ents24-API-Widgit
A demonstration of retrieving data from the Ents24 API using C#

Code written using Visual Studio 2017 and .Net Framework v4.6.1. It will probably work with earlier versions of those two though.

Project requires Newtonsoft.Json package to be available.

Usage
-----

You need client ID and secret keys for the Ents24 API in order to make requests. You can get these [here](http://developers.ents24.com/control-panel).

Once you have credentials put them into the constants at the top of Program.cs and you should be ready to go. If you commit any changes to this project remember to first remove your credentials. It is a breach of the Ents24 API agreement to make your credentials publically available.

For documentation of the Ents24 API: [API documentation](http://developers.ents24.com/api-reference).
